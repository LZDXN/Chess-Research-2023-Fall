    "# Explaining the Chess Game Analysis Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chess Game Analysis Pipeline is designed to process and analyze chess games from a PGN (Portable Game Notation) file. This pipeline is particularly tailored for filtering and categorizing games based on specific criteria such as time control and player ELO ratings. Below is an overview of its components and functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is structured around a `Pipeline` struct in Julia, which is used to manage the processing of chess games. It includes various functions for counting games, reading specific games, generating random game indices, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Global Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filename`: The path to the PGN file containing the chess games.\n",
    "- `seed`: A seed value for controlling randomness in the pipeline, ensuring reproducible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `Pipeline` Struct\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Pipeline` struct is the core of the pipeline, containing fields and methods necessary for processing the chess games.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "- `filename`: Path to the PGN file.\n",
    "- `seed`: Seed for random number generation, ensuring consistency.\n",
    "- `games_per_cell`: The target number of games for each category in the analysis matrix.\n",
    "- `matrix`: A 3x3 matrix, each cell containing an array of integers representing game indices.\n",
    "- `total_games`: Total number of games in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- `count_games_in_file`: Counts the total number of games in the PGN file.\n",
    "- `read_nth_game`: Reads the nth game from the file.\n",
    "- `random_arr`: Generates a random number within the range of total games in the file.\n",
    "- `write_file`: Writes game data to a file, either creating a new file or appending to an existing one.\n",
    "- `check_criteria`: Checks whether a game meets the specified criteria based on time controls and player ELO ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: A `Pipeline` instance is created with the specified filename and seed.\n",
    "2. **Counting Games**: The total number of games in the file is counted.\n",
    "3. **Game Selection**: Games are randomly selected and checked against specified criteria.\n",
    "4. **Criteria Checking**: Each game is evaluated to determine if it fits the desired time control and ELO range categories.\n",
    "5. **Data Storage**: Valid games are stored in the matrix, categorized based on the analysis goals.\n"
